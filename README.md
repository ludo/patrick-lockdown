## Description

**Lockdown 2.0.x does not support a Rails application that is deployed to a subdirectory, although Lockdown 1.x did.
It looks like Lockdown is no longer maintained by Andy Stone since it has been removed from github.
Therefore we use updated Lockdown 2.0.4, renamed it and added it to github.**

Lockdown is an authorization system for RubyOnRails. It is designed to handle a simple public vs private configuration to very fine grained access controls.

If you are starting a site and just have public and protected (user required) areas, use Lockdown. Lockdown includes built in user groups of public and protected. From there you can easily add/extend permissions and create new user groups as your site needs grow.

If you already have a complex permission scheme, use Lockdown to simplify the management of access rules.
